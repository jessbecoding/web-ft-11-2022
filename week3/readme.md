Catastrophe

I've created Catastrophe using Python. I utilized my knowledge of if statements to navigate the player through choices that determine the outcome of the game. The actual combat logic uses a while loop to determine if the enemy's health is below 0 that you'll win the game and break the loop. If you do not make the right choices in the game, it will lead to an instant death.
