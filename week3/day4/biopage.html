        <p>I'm from Mesa, Arizona. I've been in the area my whole life, always within an hour of my childhood home. I have three of my own pets: Gimpy, Leia, and Luci. I'm currently staying with my mom and her boyfriend, who also have two cats: Gizmo and Tuxedo. We're a little bit of a zoo. I've been married since 2020 to my highschool sweetheart. I love to read and write as well as do jigsaw puzzles!</p>
