                    Pawsibility is a pet finder app that allows you to search adoptable pets and shelters by zipcode. I was inspired to do this because I was in the middle of my own pet search.

                    To make the app, I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. I also utilized Postman and of course, the Petfinder API. I learned a lot, including how to use the question mark turnery operator in JavaScript as the Petfinder API was inconsistent in where it stored data like photos. I learned to use the elements section of the developer tools in Chrome to test CSS formatting.
                    
                    I decided on the Petfinder API because it seemed to most robust of the options I had. There was a ton of information to use and manipulate on the page. Tailwind was something I really wanted to try because I struggle with CSS. I wanted to make sure the project was a well rounded representation of what Iâ€™ve learned since November, so I used a little custom CSS to showcase that as well.

                    My name is Jessika Adams and I am a bootcamp student at DigitalCrafts. This is my Week 6 Frontend Project. I'm from Mesa, Arizona and am currently in Coolidge, Arizona with my husband and our own pets. I love coding, reading, writing, jigsaw puzzles, and training my pets. My first experience with code was with HTML way back in the MySpace days. I used to be THE gal for profile customization. I think that's why I found Tailwind easier than CSS. Thanks for stopping by!
