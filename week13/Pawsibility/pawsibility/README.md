<h1>Pawsibility 2.0</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
Pawsibility is a pet finder app that allows you to search adoptable pets by zipcode. You can also filter by animal type and distance, as well as add pets to a favorites list. I was inspired to do this because I recently went through this looking for my new puppy, Millie.

To make the app, I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, and Redux. I also utilized Postman and of course, the Petfinder API. I decided to revamp this project because I wanted to do so much more with it last time, and I loved the idea of being familiar with the API.
