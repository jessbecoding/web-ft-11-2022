## Adam's about me!

-**Hometown**: ***Winterville, NC.*** Go Pirates!

-**Favorite Food**: Anything from the Taco Bell vegetarian menu. 

-**Fun Fact**: I write poetry and riddles! Here, have a riddle:

*What hangs from a tree*

*But doesn't grow in a forest?*

*That’s such a quaint purchase,*

*It might be bought by a tourist,*

*And stored in a box for most the whole year round,*

*Till bells fill the air with a joyous sound.*

*Don’t let one drop -- it might break on the ground,*

*And scatter harmful things the whole room around.*

I'm just trying to get a decent job after dropping out of college and y'all got some awesome reviews.
