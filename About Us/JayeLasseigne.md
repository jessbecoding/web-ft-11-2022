- I like to bullet journal!

<p> I chose DC mostly because it is smaller than other bootcamps. I also liked their syllabus! 
<p> Before this bootcamp, I taught English in Japan for five years (July 2017 -- July 2022). I lived in northern Nagano Prefecture, home to snow monkeys and lots of rice fields. 
<p> My dad has a fluffy dog named Nikkita! I am obsessed with him.
